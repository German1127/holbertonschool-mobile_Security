# 0. Android App Security 

**Welcome to the Android Dynamic Analysis Challenge **
In this challenge, you’ll be provided with an APK that contains a hidden flag. Your objective is to perform **ynamic analysis**
on the app, utilizing various tools and techniques to uncover the flag and complete the exercise.

This challenge is designed to help you practice reverse engineering and dynamic analysis techniques commonly used in mobile security assessments. You’ll need to run the app on a device or emulator and use dynamic analysis tools to intercept and manipulate the app’s runtime behavior.

For this challenge, you will analyze the APK by running it and using dynamic analysis tools to modify its behavior and extract the hidden flag.

## Tools:
 - **Frida**
 - **ADB (Android Debug Bridge)**
 - **Objection**
 - **Android Studio**

Instructions: 
1. Set Up Your Environment 
 - Device/Emulator: Use an Android device or emulator with debugging enabled.
 - ADB Connection: Ensure you can connect to your device/emulator via ADB.

2. Install the APK 
 -  Use **adb install <path_to_apk>** to install the provided APK on your device or emulator.

3. Run the App 
 - Launch the app to understand its basic functionality.
 - Observe any user interface elements or interactions.

4. Identify Target Methods 
 - **Static Analysis:** Perform initial static analysis to identify interesting methods or classes to target with dynamic analysis tools.
 - **Hint:** Look for methods related to generating or revealing the flag, such as **generateString**, **revealFlag**, or any methods that take a seed or key as a parameter.

5. Use Frida to Hook Methods
 - **Write a Frida Script:** Create a script to hook into the target method(s) and modify parameters or observe return values.
 - **Modify Runtime Behavior:** Change the seed value or intercept method calls to manipulate how the app generates the flag. 
*Example:* Intercept the **generateString(seed)** method and try different seed values to find the one that reveals the flag.

6. Automate Testing 
 - **Loop Through Seed Values:** Automate the process of testing multiple seed values by looping through a range (e.g., 0 to 1000).
 - **Check for the Flag:** After modifying the seed, observe the output to see if the generated string matches the expected flag format.

7. Extract the Flag 
 - Once you’ve found the correct seed that generates the flag, record the flag.
 - Ensure the flag matches the format specified in the challenge (e.g., starts with **Holberton{** and ends with**}**).

## General Hints for Success
 - **Understand the App’s Logic:** Before hooking methods, try to understand how the app works and what methods are likely involved in flag generation.
 - **Start Simple:** Begin by hooking methods that are easy to intercept, then move on to more complex interactions.
 - **Use Logging:** In your Frida scripts, use **console.log()** to output information that can help you understand what’s happening.
 - **Handle Errors:** Ensure your scripts handle exceptions or errors to avoid crashes.
 - **Automate Carefully:** When automating tests (e.g., looping through seeds), ensure you manage resources and avoid overloading the app or device.
