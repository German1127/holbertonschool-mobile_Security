#  0. Mobile_Security 
Welcome to the **Android Static Analysis Challenge!** In this exercise, your objective is to uncover a hidden flag within an **APK file** using static analysis techniques. The challenge focuses on helping you practice reverse engineering and static analysis commonly used in mobile security assessments. No need to run the app

- everything you need can be discovered through analyzing the APK statically.

The purpose of the challenge is to retrieve the correct input that the mobile application is asking. Using a disassembler or a decompiler like **Jadx** could help understanding how the check is performed.

```
Useful Instructions:
1-Extract the APK: Start by extracting the contents of the APK (an APK is a ZIP file) and inspect the included files such as the AndroidManifest.xml.
2-Decompile the Code: Use decompilation tools to convert the APK into readable Java or Smali code for analysis.
3-Search for Obfuscation: Look for obfuscated methods, string manipulation, or encoded data, which might be concealing the flag.
4-Analyze Strings and Resources: Review files like strings.xml and other resources for clues.
5-Rebuild the Flag: If you find fragments or obfuscated elements, reverse the process to recover the complete flag.
```
his challenge will give you a hands-on experience with **Android static analysis** and allow you to explore real-world techniques used in reverse engineering and security research.

# 1. Communication Between Device and Backend 
This challenge is designed to help you understand how mobile apps communicate with backend servers. In modern applications, data such as user information or device details is often sent from the device to a server using network requests. In this task, you will simulate sending device information to an obfuscated domain over HTTP, allowing you to explore the mechanics of communication between a mobile device and a backend server.

Your objective is to simulate a scenario where device information is sent from a mobile app to a backend server via an HTTP POST request. The task involves analyzing how this data is transmitted, understanding the HTTP protocol, and identifying potential security risks in the communication process. The communication involves device details formatted in JSON and sent over HTTP, simulating real-world client-server interactions.

```
Useful Instructions:
1-Craft HTTP POST Request: Simulate sending device information (e.g., model, manufacturer) to the server.
2-Use JSON Format: Format the data as JSON before sending it to the backend.
3-Handle Responses: Implement asynchronous handling of server responses to ensure the app doesn't freeze.
4-Error Handling: Ensure graceful handling of potential errors, such as network failures or server issues.
5-Logging: Use debugging tools to monitor the communication process and capture any issues.
```

## Tools and Libraries: 

- OkHttp
- Android Logcat
- JSON Formatter

The goal is to successfully send device information over HTTP using OkHttp, handle the server’s response, and debug the communication using Logcat. Additionally, understanding potential security risks and error-handling mechanisms is crucial to completing this task.

# 2. Reverse Engineering & Optimization Challenges 
In this set of challenges, you’ll engage with tasks focused on reverse engineering, mathematical computation, and algorithm optimization. Your goal is to analyze compiled programs, solve computational problems, and improve performance through optimization techniques. These tasks will push your problem-solving abilities, requiring you to understand, break down, and enhance the efficiency of code and algorithms.

- **-Reverse Engineering:** Analyze compiled code to understand its structure, uncover hidden logic, or reveal data processing methods.
- **-Mathematical Computation:** Solve complex problems involving recursion, matrix operations, or cryptographic algorithms.
- **-Optimization:** Identify inefficient code and improve its time or space complexity to enhance performance.

```
Useful Instructions:
1-Analyze the Code:
    * For reverse engineering tasks, begin by loading the application into tools like `Ghidra` or `JADX` to observe how it processes data.
    * Use static analysis (reading the code without running it) and dynamic analysis (observing its behavior in real-time).
2-Use Mathematical Tools:
    * For computation-heavy challenges, test your algorithms in Python using libraries like `NumPy` or math to check for inefficiencies.
    * Apply Big O analysis to understand the growth rate of your algorithm.
3-Optimize with Profiling: 
    * Use tools like `Valgrind` or `GDB` to find performance bottlenecks.
    * Apply techniques like memoization (caching results to avoid redundant calculations) and dynamic programming (breaking problems into subproblems).
4-Test Iteratively: 
    * After optimizing, repeatedly test your program to ensure it runs faster while producing correct results.
```

## Tools:

- Reverse Engineering: **Ghidra, JADX, Frida.**
- Mathematical Computation: **Python, NumPy.**
- Optimization: **Valgrind, GDB, Memoization, Dynamic Programming.**

This set of tasks is designed to test your ability to break down problems, analyze them from multiple angles, and apply optimization techniques to improve performance. Throughout the challenges, you’ll encounter real world scenarios where a deep understanding of reverse engineering, mathematical computation, and optimization is essential.

# 3. Static Analysis and Native Libraries
This challenge focuses on the concepts of reverse engineering, static analysis, and native library integration in Android applications. The task will require you to dive deep into the Android APK structure and understand how Java and C (JNI) communicate in order to solve the challenge. You’ll explore the complexities of analyzing an APK, investigating both the Java side and the compiled native library (.so file), which plays a key role in the overall application flow. Understanding these components is crucial to gaining insight into the internals of Android applications, especially when native code is involved.

**Challenge**Analyze an APK to understand its structure and the role of native libraries. Reverse engineer the native library (.so file) to comprehend its functionality and interaction with Java code via JNI. Identify any obfuscation techniques used in the APK and native library. Explore the interaction between Java and C code to understand data flow and potential security vulnerabilities.

```
Useful Instructions
1-APK Decompilation: Use tools like JADX and APKTool to decompile the APK and inspect its structure, including DEX files and resources.
2-Static Analysis of Native Libraries: Utilize Ghidra or IDA Pro to disassemble and analyze the native library (.so file). Focus on disassembly, function analysis, and identifying key operations.
3-Exploring JNI: Understand how JNI facilitates communication between Java and native code. Check for JNI function signatures and validate how user inputs are processed in the native library
4-Obfuscation Identification: Look for common obfuscation techniques used in the APK. Analyze method names, control flows, and debug symbols to recognize any protective measures that may hinder reverse engineering.
5-Dynamic Analysis: If necessary, leverage Frida to dynamically analyze the APK. This can help you monitor function calls and observe the runtime behavior of both Java and native code.
