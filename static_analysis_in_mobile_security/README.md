Welcome to the **Android Static Analysis Challenge!** In this exercise, your objective is to uncover a hidden flag within an **APK file** using static analysis techniques. The challenge focuses on helping you practice reverse engineering and static analysis commonly used in mobile security assessments. No need to run the app

- everything you need can be discovered through analyzing the APK statically.

The purpose of the challenge is to retrieve the correct input that the mobile application is asking. Using a disassembler or a decompiler like **Jadx** could help understanding how the check is performed.

```
Useful Instructions:
1-Extract the APK: Start by extracting the contents of the APK (an APK is a ZIP file) and inspect the included files such as the AndroidManifest.xml.
2-Decompile the Code: Use decompilation tools to convert the APK into readable Java or Smali code for analysis.
3-Search for Obfuscation: Look for obfuscated methods, string manipulation, or encoded data, which might be concealing the flag.
4-Analyze Strings and Resources: Review files like strings.xml and other resources for clues.
5-Rebuild the Flag: If you find fragments or obfuscated elements, reverse the process to recover the complete flag.
```
his challenge will give you a hands-on experience with **Android static analysis** and allow you to explore real-world techniques used in reverse engineering and security research.
